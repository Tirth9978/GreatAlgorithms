## Quick Core Ideas 
- Combinatorics: Counting without enumerating
- Permutations: Order matters → nPr = n!/(n-r)!
- Combinations: Order doesn't matter → nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)
- Inclusion-Exclusion: |A∪B| = |A| + |B| - |A∩B|

##  Frequently Asked Problems 
- nCr modulo prime (precomputation + Fermat)
- Count valid parentheses (Catalan numbers)
- Grid unique paths (C(m+n-2, m-1))
- Dice throw combinations (DP or inclusion-exclusion)
- Birthday paradox probability (1 - 365Pn/365^n)
- Count subsets with sum/product constraints
- Arrangements with restrictions (derangements)
- Divisor counting & sum problems
